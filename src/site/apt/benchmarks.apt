Benchmarks

  I used {{{http://www.xenoclast.org/autobench/}autobench}} to perform the tests. Basically this is a perl script that
  sits on top of {{{http://code.google.com/p/httperf/}httperf}} and will run multiple tests in succession outputting the
  results to TSV.

  All the tests were run against the same <<<robots.txt>>> file:

---------------------------------------------
autobench --single_host --host1 localhost \
                        --port1 8080 \
                        --uri1 /robots.txt \
                        --quiet \
                        --low_rate 20 \
                        --high_rate 200 \
                        --rate_step 20 \
                        --num_call 10 \
                        --num_conn 5000 \
                        --timeout 5 \
                        --file shs-benchmarks.tsv
---------------------------------------------

  with a series of tests starting at 20 connections per second (with 10 requests per connection), and increasing by 20
  connections per second until 200 connections a second are being requested. Each test will comprise a total of 5000
  connections, and any responses which take longer than 5 seconds to arrive will be counted as errors. The results will
  be saved in the file 'shs-benchmarks.tsv'.
