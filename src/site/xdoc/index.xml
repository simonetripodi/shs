    <section name="Welcome to the Simple HttpServer!">
      <p>Simple HttpServer is an implementation of a Web Server in Java that supports:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>pure HTTP protocol;</li>
        <li>enhanced APIs inspired by servlet model;</li>
        <li>100% based on NIO APIs;</li>
        <li>multi-threading requests processor;</li>
        <li>EDSL configuration APIs;</li>
        <li>Request incremental pull parser;</li>
        <li>...</li>
      </ul>
      <p>See how <a href="api.html">APIs</a> and <a href="core.html">core</a> implementation work!</p>
      <p>There is also a <a href="demo.html">demo</a> that shows the server potentials.</p>
      <p>Do you wants to rebuild all yourself? See the <a href="developers.html">developers</a> page!</p>

    <section name="Acknowledgements">
      <p>This work is dedicated to my city, L'Aquila, destroyed by a terrible
      earthquake the 6th April, 2009... That day more than 300 people were killed
      because buildings collapsed after a magnitudo 6.3 earthquake at 3:32 am.</p>

      <p>I'll never forget that episode.</p>

      <p>A big thank you goes also to: my lovely wife, mom, dad and bro for believing in me,
      Tommaso, Marco, Ivan, Daniele, Emanuele and Christian for their priceless friendship.</p>
