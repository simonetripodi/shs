Introduction

  ${project.description}

Install ${project.name}

  ${project.name} is a Java tool, so you must have Java installed in order to proceed. Users need at least the
  Java Runtime Environment (JRE), the Java Development Kit (JDK) is a plus.

  [[1]] Extract the distribution archive, i.e. ${project.build.finalName}.tar.gz to the directory you
        wish to install ${project.artifactId}.
        These instructions assume you chose `/usr/local/${project.build.finalName}`.
        The subdirectory `${project.build.finalName}` will be created from the archive.

  [[2]] Add ${project.name} to your path, e.g.

            `export PATH=/usr/local/${project.build.finalName}/bin:$PATH`

  [[3]] Make sure that JAVA_HOME is set to the location of your JDK, e.g. `export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.6.0_29`
        and that $JAVA_HOME/bin is in your PATH environment variable.

Run ${project.name}

  Open the shell and type `shs -h` to see the available options:
